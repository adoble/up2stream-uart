# Driver for the Up2Stream Pro board 

A driver for the Arylic Up2Stream Pro board. 

This is work in progress.

## To Do
* Test out the driver on real hardware.

* As the parameter-types file is getting large, put each type in a seperate file - together with test code - and reexport from parameter-types.
* Complete the functions marked todo. 
* Provide some configuration for differences between firmware version 3 and 4
